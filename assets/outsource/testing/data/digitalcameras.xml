    <description>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buy.com/prod/canon-powershot-sx150-is-14-1-megapixel-digital-camera-black/223775960.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/125/223775960.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; width=&quot;75&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#006699; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;Memory-Making Made Easy. 
Discover how simple and easy it is to be creative and shoot memorable photos and videos of your favorite subjects with the PowerShot SX150 IS digital camera. Its compact size makes it convenient to carry around everywhere to capture those special moments that can happen anytime! Sporting a stylish design, it comes in two great colors: Black and Red. 14.1 Megapixels deliver stunning image detail and enable you to make beautiful large prints. 12x Optical Zoom lets you get close to distant subjects, while the 28mm wide-angle capability makes this camera great for photographing large groups of people and scenic landscapes. Advanced technologies, such as Intelligent IS and Smart AUTO, make it easy and effortless to capture gorgeous still images and HD video. It all makes the PowerShot SX150 IS the perfect camera to capture the good times, wherever you might be.

12x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens
The PowerShot SX150 IS features a powerful Genuine Canon 12x Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. With precision engineering and decades of leadership in optical technologies, Canon has created a bright, wide-angle lens that provides an extraordinary 12x zoom range. The lens starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 336mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), giving you tremendous coverage and reach. The telephoto end lets you capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. Moreover, this superlative lens incorporates innovative designs that enable it to fit the compact profile of the PowerShot SX150 IS and perform at high speed with low power consumption. 

Optical Image Stabilizer
Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For still photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.

12.2 Megapixel APS-C Size CMOS Sensor
DIGIC 4 Image Processor
 The improved DIGIC 4 Image Processor ensures that images are captured, processed and saved with remarkable speed. The EOS Rebel T3 DSLR&amp;amp;rsquo;s new 3:2 multiple aspect ratio, in-camera RAW image processing, creative filters, image resizing and provided S2 and S3 image-recording quality are all possible thanks to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. With dazzling results, the new DIGIC 4 Image Processor also works to capture and process data of images shot at 12.2 Megapixels at 3.0 fps, as well as 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, enhanced Face Detection Live mode, Full HD video recording, Auto Lighting Optimizer and Lens Peripheral Optimization. 
Excellence from Dawn to Dusk.

With enhanced high-sensitivity optimization, subjects can be captured clearly and easily at high shutter speeds without flash, with minimized blur and noise. In bright scenes, especially long exposures in daylight, optimal exposure can be achieved with a fully open wide-diameter lens, no dark filter needed. 
High Definition Made Easy.
Improved EOS HD Movie mode with expanded recording [HD: 30p (29.97) / 25p], and with in-camera video editing options.
The EOS Rebel T3 DSLR&amp;amp;rsquo;s expanded repertoire of technologies includes shooting video in brilliantly clear, exactingly sharp high definition for playback on your HDTV! Shooting at 1280 x 720 at 30 (29.97) or 25 frames per second, HD video can be taken immediately through the EOS Rebel T3 camera&amp;amp;rsquo;s intuitive operation and layout. Parameters for white balance and picture style are already set &amp;amp;mdash; just grab and go!Incredible AutoFocus.
High speed, reliable 9-point AF system utilizing a high precision, f/5.6 cross-type center point.

    </title>
    <description>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buy.com/prod/samsung-nx1000-20-3-megapixel-white-digital-camera-kit-w-20-50mm-lens/230523947.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/125/230523947.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; width=&quot;75&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#006699; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;Style and Perfection, All in One. Introducing the 20.3 megapixels Samsung Smart Camera NX1000 with 1/4000 fast shutter and Built-in WiFi.

20.3MP APS-C SensorCustomized for the NX System, the brand-new, professional-grade, 20.3MP APS-C CMOS Sensor produces images that rival those of any premium DSLR. Each individual pixel has a large sensor area and receives more light, guaranteeing low noise levels, high dynamic range and accurate color differentiation. The higher sensitivity allows you to shoot during low-light situations without graininess or other noise. The new sensor also provides Full HD video output capabilities.

1/4000 Fast ShutterShutter speed can make the difference between capturing an iconic image and missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The NX1000’s 1/4000 shutter speed gives you the flexibility to shoot like the pros—at varying speeds and light exposures. The NX1000’s shutter even automatically adjusts itself as it senses environmental factors such as temperature and camera direction. And the electronically controlled focal-plane shutter reduces exposure errors.

High Speed CaptureThe NX1000 features super-fast High Speed Capture capabilities provide an simple yet sophisticated way to capture images in total focus. The ultra-high speed Auto Focus (AF) that can rival almost any system camera and is core component of the system. The result is a fast and precise AF System that captures life’s fleeting moments. And with a sequential rate of 8fps, capturing fast-moving objects in perfect clarity are no longer a challenge.

Discover the True Beauty of HD VideoBuilt with 1080 30p Full HD movie recording capabilities, the NX1000 transforms shooting video with a still camera into an art form. Choose from a wide range of viewing angles and zoom with confidence. The mirrorless CMOS image sensor offers precise auto focus even while you shoot. For a truly cinematic experience, the NX System has been fitted with an 18-200mm lens exclusively for Full HD video.

Instant Sharing via Wi-FiThe NX1000’s Wi-Fi connectivity lets you connect your digital camera to a wireless network. Save photos and videos directly to a computer or cloud service while you shoot, email them, print them wirelessly, or upload them straight to Facebook™, Twitter or YouTube. You’ll never have to worry about losing a great shot, running out of storage space, or remembering to bring the right cable along.

Premium Metal DesignThe NX1000 packs the power of a professional-grade digital camera within a sleek and compact design. Its ergonomically crafted exterior fits perfectly within your hand, while the topside design feels solid and looks just as sturdy. The NX System gets its charming good looks through the perfect combination of modern metallic styling and classic clean lines. On the inside, the large CMOS Sensor replaces any mirrors for a smaller camera body. The lightweight body makes it more portable and easier to shoot in a variety of angles and positions, making it the ultimate professional-grade camera that you can carry in your pocket.

Smart Filter 2.0 and Selective ColorSmart Filter 2.0 options make it easy to create special moods. Choose the Tilt &amp;amp; Shift Lens Effect for a miniaturized look, the Vignetting Effect for striking contrasts, Half-Tone Dot for a comic-book look, and more. With the Selective Color feature, you can even choose the colors you want to emphasize.

Wide Range ISO for Perfect ExposureThe wrong exposure can ruin even the most carefully framed shot. The NX System’s imaging sensor offers a wide ISO sensitivity range of up to 12,800 at normal settings. Even indoors or at night, you can create images with minimal noise, rich tonal gradations and faithful colors—without a flash. You’ll also capture clearer, crisper images of fast-moving objects.

Panorama, 3D PanoramaCapture the sweeping beauty of a natural landscape or the grandeur of a vast skyline. The NX1000’s panoramic capabilities let you catch every detail on the horizon with the push of a button. You can even create 3D panoramic photos and wow your friends by displaying them on a 3D-ready HDTV.

Smart PanelThe intuitive Smart Panel user interface puts all the settings you need right at your fingertips. Every key feature is easy to access, thanks to on-screen icons and clearly explained menu items. That means faster adjustments so you won’t miss that perfect shot.

Take Full Control of Your PicturesNo more fumbling to find the right buttons while you try to capture a fleeting moment. With i-Function 2.0, you can adjust key settings using the focus ring right on the lens. Whether you’re a novice or a seasoned pro, you can quickly choose the perfect settings for your shot.

    Olympus Stylus Tough 8010 14 Megapixel Compact Camera - Silver - 5X Wide-Angle Optical Zoom, 2.7&quot; LCD, Waterproof, HD Movie
    
    </title>
    <description>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buy.com/prod/olympus-stylus-tough-8010-14-megapixel-compact-camera-silver-5x-wide/214120187.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/125/214120187.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; width=&quot;75&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#006699; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT.

Attention adventure-seekers: this is the go-anywhere, do-anything camera you’ve been waiting for. It snaps stunning photos -- and records HD movies -- wherever you are. Hurtling down a rugged trail. Plunging underwater. Balancing on your snowboard. The STYLUS TOUGH-8010 is engineered to thrive in any conditions.

 The Olympus Stylus Tough-8010 is a compact 14-Megapixel digital camera with a 28mm 5x optical zoom lens designed for people with an active lifestyle. The camera is waterproof to 33' (10.06m), shockproof to 6.6' (2.01m), crushproof to 220 lbs of pressure, and freezeproof to 14&amp;#176;f (-10&amp;#176;c). This makes the camera perfect for beach going, swimming, skiing, climbing, hiking or any other outdoor activity, or tough environment. 

Setting the camera for the perfect photo is easy with scene modes that include Beach, Underwater Snapshot, Underwater Wide 1, Underwater Wide 2, Underwater Macro and Pets. Accessing the camera's controls is a snap with Tap Control. This is especially convenient underwater or while wearing gloves. 

The camera has features that allow you to capture the action even in low light. Dual Image Stabilization will keep your images sharp, and if the image is better captured in motion, the camera will take HD videos. The 2.7&amp;quot; LCD screen allows you to compose your still and video images and review them after capture. The camera takes SD/SDHC memory cards, but the built-in 2GB of internal memory allows you to take many photographs without a memory card. All of these features make the Olympus Stylus Tough-8010 the perfect camera to take with you when the going gets tough.

    <p:description>TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT.

Attention adventure-seekers: this is the go-anywhere, do-anything camera you’ve been waiting for. It snaps stunning photos -- and records HD movies -- wherever you are. Hurtling down a rugged trail. Plunging underwater. Balancing on your snowboard. The STYLUS TOUGH-8010 is engineered to thrive in any conditions.

 The Olympus Stylus Tough-8010 is a compact 14-Megapixel digital camera with a 28mm 5x optical zoom lens designed for people with an active lifestyle. The camera is waterproof to 33' (10.06m), shockproof to 6.6' (2.01m), crushproof to 220 lbs of pressure, and freezeproof to 14&#176;f (-10&#176;c). This makes the camera perfect for beach going, swimming, skiing, climbing, hiking or any other outdoor activity, or tough environment. 

Setting the camera for the perfect photo is easy with scene modes that include Beach, Underwater Snapshot, Underwater Wide 1, Underwater Wide 2, Underwater Macro and Pets. Accessing the camera's controls is a snap with Tap Control. This is especially convenient underwater or while wearing gloves. 

The camera has features that allow you to capture the action even in low light. Dual Image Stabilization will keep your images sharp, and if the image is better captured in motion, the camera will take HD videos. The 2.7&quot; LCD screen allows you to compose your still and video images and review them after capture. The camera takes SD/SDHC memory cards, but the built-in 2GB of internal memory allows you to take many photographs without a memory card. All of these features make the Olympus Stylus Tough-8010 the perfect camera to take with you when the going gets tough.

Then, proudly display your artistic creation on the camera's LCD, or by simple upload to social networking sites to give everyone the chance to look at your work--which you might even decide to make your latest profile picture! The exciting Motion Photo feature lets you feel like a Hollywood blockbuster filmmaker: Freeze time around a moving subject for dramatic effect. Capture your friend leaping in the park while keeping everyone else around him or her still.

    Canon PowerShot ELPH 110 HS 16 Megapixel Digital Camera, Black
    
    </title>
    <description>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buy.com/prod/canon-powershot-elph-110-hs-16-megapixel-digital-camera-black/228195368.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/125/228195368.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; width=&quot;75&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#006699; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;Style, Sophistication, and Power.

Slim and curvy, the PowerShot ELPH 110 HS is a natural fit for your hand. Easy operability and reliable high-quality performance are reason enough to carry it everywhere, but you'll also love the attention-getting quality of the camera's distinctly sophisticated modern design. The matte finish in a wide range of vivid, highly expressive colors projects your taste and style like a fashion accessory, but the PowerShot ELPH 110 HS has its serious side, too. A 16.1 Megapixel high-sensitivity sensor plus Canon's DIGIC 5 Image Processor deliver impeccable image quality and high-performance features never before possible. Experience Face ID that recognizes and optimizes images of your friends and family, Intelligent IS that creates sharp, steady shots in a wide variety of situations, and stunning Full HD Video. Smart AUTO lives up to its name, letting you shoot anywhere, anytime as the mood strikes, confident that the camera will automatically make your images the best they can be.

Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor
The latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background.

Intelligent IS

The latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.

The lens starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 336mm telephoto &#40;35mm equivalent&#41;&#44; giving you tremendous coverage and reach. The telephoto end lets you capture subjects from a considerable distance&#44; while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes&#44; large groups of people and tall buildings.

Canon&#39;s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations&#44; providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk&#44; inside without a flash&#44; and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For still photos&#44; it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds&#44; accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced&#44; you get a sharper&#44; steadier image.
